# MailTumble Marketing/ Landing Page site

This is the marketing website deployed at https://mailtumble.app/

This is hosted by github pages, using the static site files synced to the "pages" branch. Do not commmit changes to this branch manually, it's contents are generated by the GitHub Pages npm script.

# Deploying locally

run the following commands in sequence: 

  git clone https://github.com/Mail-Tumble/landing.git
  cd landing
  npm install
  npm run start
  
# Publishes changes

## Automatically

This repository has been configured with a GitHub action that builds the static files and runs the deploy script to sync them to the "Pages" branch. 

Make changes on "development" or your own branch and then make a pull request to the master branch. If this can be automatically merged and is accepted the Action will trigger and your changes will go live.

## Manually

Locally while on the master branch run the following commands: 

  npm install
  npm run build
  npm run deploy
  
Terminal/CMD will ask you to log in, but bear in mind that you will need to use a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token), rather than your password, as this repository is secured by 2FA
